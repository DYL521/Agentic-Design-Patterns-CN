# A Thought Leader's Perspective: Power and Responsibility
思想领袖的观点 ：权力与责任


Of all the technology cycles I’ve witnessed over the past four decades—from the birth of the personal computer and the web, to the revolutions in mobile and cloud—none has felt quite like this one. For years, the discourse around Artificial Intelligence was a familiar rhythm of hype and disillusionment, the so-called “AI summers” followed by long, cold winters. But this time, something is different. The conversation has palpably shifted. If the last eighteen months were
过去四十年，我见证了无数技术周期——从个人电脑和互联网的诞生，到移动和云计算的革命——但从未有过一次像这次这样令人震撼。多年来，围绕人工智能的讨论总是伴随着熟悉的炒作和幻灭，所谓的“人工智能夏天”之后是漫长而寒冷的冬天。但这一次，情况有所不同。讨论的重点发生了明显的转变。如果说过去的十八个月是

about the engine—the breathtaking, almost vertical ascent of Large Language Models (LLMs)—the next era will be about the car we build around it. It will be about the frameworks that harness this raw power, transforming it from a generator of plausible text into a true agent of action.
关于引擎——大型语言模型（LLM）令人叹为观止、近乎垂直的上升——下一个时代将是关于我们围绕它打造的汽车。它将是关于驾驭这种原始力量的框架，将其从可信文本的生成器转化为真正的行动代理。


I admit, I began as a skeptic. Plausibility, I’ve found, is often inversely proportional to one’s own knowledge of a subject. Early models, for all their fluency, felt like they were operating with a kind of impostor syndrome, optimized for credibility over correctness. But then came the inflection point, a step-change brought about by a new class of "reasoning" models. Suddenly, we weren't just conversing with a statistical machine that predicted the next word in a sequence;
我承认，一开始我是个怀疑论者。我发现，可信度通常与一个人对某个主题的了解程度成反比。早期的模型虽然流畅，但感觉像是在用一种冒名顶替综合症来运作，优化可信度而非正确性。但后来出现了一个转折点，一类新的“推理”模型带来了阶跃式的改变。突然之间，我们不再只是在与一台预测序列中下一个单词的统计机器对话；

we were getting a peek into a nascent form of cognition.
我们正在一窥新生的认知形式。


The first time I experimented with one of the new agentic coding tools, I felt that familiar spark of magic. I tasked it with a personal project I’d never found the time for: migrating a charity website from a simple web builder to a proper, modern CI/CD environment. For the next twenty minutes, it went to work, asking clarifying questions, requesting credentials, and providing status updates. It felt less like using a tool and more like collaborating with a junior developer. When it presented me with a fully deployable package, complete with impeccable documentation and unit tests, I was floored.
第一次尝试新的代理编码工具时，我感受到了那种熟悉的魔力。我把一个我一直没时间做的个人项目交给了它：将一个慈善网站从一个简单的网页构建器迁移到一个合适的、现代化的 CI/CD 环境。在接下来的二十分钟里，它开始工作，询问澄清问题、请求凭证并提供状态更新。感觉不像是在使用工具，更像是在与初级开发人员协作。当它向我展示一个完全可部署的软件包，以及无可挑剔的文档和单元测试时，我惊呆了。


Of course, it wasn't perfect. It made mistakes. It got stuck. It required my supervision and, crucially, my judgment to steer it back on course. The experience drove home a lesson I’ve learned the hard way over a long career: you cannot afford to trust blindly. Yet, the process was fascinating. Peeking into its "chain of thought" was like watching a mind at work—messy, non-linear, full of starts, stops, and self-corrections, not unlike our own human reasoning. It wasn’t a straight line; it was a random walk toward a solution. Here was the kernel of something new: not just an intelligence that could generate content, but one that could generate a plan.
当然，它并不完美。它会犯错，会卡住。它需要我的监督，更重要的是，需要我的判断力，才能让它回到正轨。这段经历让我深刻体会到，在漫长的职业生涯中，我吃尽了苦头才学到的教训：不能盲目信任。然而，这个过程却引人入胜。窥视它的“思维链”，就像观察一个正在运作的大脑——混乱、非线性，充满启动、停止和自我修正，与我们人类的推理方式并无二致。它并非直线前进，而是随机地走向解决方案。这揭示了某种新事物的核心：它不仅是一种能够生成内容的智能，更是一种能够生成计划的智能 。


This is the promise of agentic frameworks. It’s the difference between a static subway map and a dynamic GPS that reroutes you in real-time. A classic rules-based automaton follows a fixed path; when it encounters an unexpected obstacle, it breaks. An AI agent, powered by a reasoning model, has the potential to observe, adapt, and find another way. It possesses a form of digital common sense that allows it to navigate the countless edge cases of reality. It represents a shift from simply telling a computer what to do, to explaining why we need something done and trusting it to figure out the how.
这就是代理框架的前景。它就像静态地铁地图和实时重新规划路线的动态 GPS 之间的区别。经典的基于规则的自动机遵循固定路径；当它遇到意外障碍时，就会崩溃。而由推理模型驱动的人工智能代理则拥有观察、适应并找到其他路径的潜力。它拥有一种数字常识，使其能够应对现实中无数的边缘情况。它代表着一种转变，从简单地告诉计算机做什么 ，到解释我们为什么需要做某事，并相信它能够找到方法 。


As exhilarating as this new frontier is, it brings a profound sense of responsibility, particularly from my vantage point as the CIO of a global financial institution. The stakes are immeasurably high. An agent that makes a mistake while creating a recipe for a "Chicken Salmon Fusion Pie" is a fun anecdote. An agent that makes a mistake while executing a trade, managing risk, or handling client data is a real problem. I’ve read the disclaimers and the cautionary tales: the web automation agent that, after failing a login, decided to email a member of parliament to complain about login walls. It’s a darkly humorous reminder that we are dealing with a technology we don’t fully understand.
这一新领域令人振奋，但也带来了深刻的责任感，尤其从我作为一家全球金融机构首席信息官的角度来看，更是如此。风险高得难以估量。一个代理在制作“鸡肉三文鱼融合派”食谱时犯错，或许是一个有趣的轶事。一个代理在执行交易、管理风险或处理客户数据时犯错，则是一个真正的问题。我读过免责声明和警示故事：一位网络自动化代理在登录失败后，决定给一位议员发邮件，抱怨登录墙。这以一种黑色幽默的方式提醒我们，我们正在应对一项我们并不完全理解的技术。


This is where craft, culture, and a relentless focus on our principles become our essential guide. Our Engineering Tenets are not just words on a page; they are our compass. We must Build with Purpose, ensuring that every agent we design starts from a clear understanding of the client problem we are solving. We must Look Around Corners, anticipating failure modes and designing systems that are resilient by design. And above all, we must Inspire Trust, by being transparent about our methods and accountable for our outcomes.
正是在这里，精湛的工艺、丰富的文化以及对原则的不懈追求，成为了我们不可或缺的指南针。我们的工程信条并非纸上谈兵，而是我们的指南针。我们必须 “有目的地构建” ，确保我们设计的每个代理都始于对客户问题的清晰理解。我们必须 “环顾四周” ，预测故障模式，并设计出具有弹性的系统。最重要的是，我们必须 “激发信任” ，对我们的方法保持透明，并对结果负责。


In an agentic world, these tenets take on new urgency. The hard truth is that you cannot simply overlay these powerful new tools onto messy, inconsistent systems and expect good results. Messy systems plus agents are a recipe for disaster. An AI trained on "garbage" data doesn’t just produce garbage-out; it produces plausible, confident garbage that can poison an entire process. Therefore, our first and most critical task is to prepare the ground. We must invest in clean data, consistent metadata, and well-defined APIs. We have to build the modern "interstate system" that allows these agents to operate safely and at high velocity. It is the hard,
在一个充满代理的世界里，这些原则显得更加紧迫。残酷的事实是，你不能简单地将这些强大的新工具套用在混乱、不一致的系统上，并期望获得良好的结果。混乱的系统加上代理，最终只会酿成灾难。用“垃圾”数据训练的人工智能不仅会产生垃圾输出，还会生成看似合理、充满信心的垃圾数据，最终毒害整个流程。因此，我们首要且最关键的任务是做好准备。我们必须投资于干净的数据、一致的元数据和定义明确的 API。我们必须构建一个现代化的“州际系统”，让这些代理能够安全、高效地运行。这才是真正艰难的，

foundational work of building a programmable enterprise, an "enterprise as software," where our processes are as well-architected as our code.
构建可编程企业的基础工作，即“软件企业”，其中我们的流程与我们的代码一样架构良好。


Ultimately, this journey is not about replacing human ingenuity, but about augmenting it. It demands a new set of skills from all of us: the ability to explain a task with clarity, the wisdom to delegate, and the diligence to verify the quality of the output. It requires us to be humble, to acknowledge what we don’t know, and to never stop learning. The pages that follow in this book offer a technical map for building these new frameworks. My hope is that you will use them not just to build what is possible, but to build what is right, what is robust, and what is responsible.
归根结底，这段旅程并非要取代人类的创造力，而是要增强它。它要求我们每个人都掌握一套新的技能：清晰地解释任务的能力、委派任务的智慧，以及验证产出质量的勤奋。它要求我们保持谦逊，承认自己的不足，并永不停止学习。本书接下来的内容将为构建这些新框架提供技术路线图。我希望​​你不仅能用它们构建可能，还能构建正确、稳健和负责任的框架。


The world is asking every engineer to step up. I am confident we are ready for the challenge.
全世界都在呼吁每一位工程师奋起直追。我相信我们已经做好了迎接挑战的准备。


Enjoy the journey.  享受旅程。
