## Principles for Leading the Augmented Team
## 领导增强团队的原则

Successfully leading this framework requires evolving from a sole contributor into the lead of a human-AI team, guided by the following principles:

成功领导这个框架需要从单独贡献者发展成为人类-AI 团队的领导者,遵循以下原则:

* **Maintain Architectural Ownership** Your role is to set the strategic direction and own the high-level architecture. You define the "what" and the "why," using the agent team to accelerate the "how." You are the final **arbiter** of design, ensuring every component aligns with the project's long-term vision and quality standards.  

* **保持架构所有权** 你的角色是设定战略方向并拥有高层架构。你定义"做什么"和"为什么",使用智能体团队来加速"如何做"。你是设计的最终**仲裁者**,确保每个组件都与项目的长期愿景和质量标准保持一致。

* **Master the Art of the Brief** The quality of an agent's output is a direct reflection of the quality of its input. Master the art of the brief by providing clear, unambiguous, and comprehensive context for every task. Think of your prompt not as a simple command, but as a complete briefing package for a new, highly capable team member.  

* **掌握简报的艺术** 智能体输出的质量直接反映了其输入的质量。通过为每个任务提供清晰、明确和全面的上下文来掌握简报的艺术。将你的提示视为不是简单的命令,而是为新的、高能力团队成员提供的完整简报包。

* **Act as the Ultimate Quality Gate** An agent's output is always a proposal, never a command. Treat the Reviewer Agent's feedback as a powerful signal, but you are the ultimate quality gate. Apply your domain expertise and project-specific knowledge to validate, challenge, and approve all changes, acting as the final guardian of the codebase's integrity.  

* **充当最终质量关口** 智能体的输出始终是一个提议,而不是命令。将审查者智能体的反馈视为强大的信号,但你是最终的质量关口。运用你的领域专业知识和项目特定知识来验证、质疑和批准所有更改,充当代码库完整性的最终守护者。

* **Engage in Iterative Dialogue** The best results emerge from conversation, not monologue. If an agent's initial output is imperfect, don't discard it—refine it. Provide corrective feedback, add clarifying context, and prompt for another attempt. This iterative dialogue is crucial, especially with the Reviewer Agent, whose "Reflection" output is designed to be the start of a collaborative discussion, not just a final report.

* **参与迭代对话** 最好的结果来自对话,而不是独白。如果智能体的初始输出不完美,不要丢弃它——而是改进它。提供纠正性反馈,添加澄清性上下文,并提示再次尝试。这种迭代对话至关重要,特别是与审查者智能体的对话,其"反思"输出旨在成为协作讨论的开始,而不仅仅是最终报告。
